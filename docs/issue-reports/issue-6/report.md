### Editorâ€™s Note

This document provides a structured, audit-ready breakdown of the requirements specified in the **NPP Regulations v7.0 (20 May 2020)**.

*   **Source Document Scope:** The analysis is strictly based on the provided `Regulations for NEW PAYMENTS PLATFORM (NPP) Version 7.0_20 May 2020`. All requirement IDs, descriptions, and source citations refer to this document.
*   **Confirmation of Payee (CoP):** The user request specified coverage for Confirmation of Payee (CoP) from Part 18 of a later version (v21.0). The provided source document, v7.0, **does not contain Part 18 or explicit CoP requirements**.
*   **Mandated Payments Service (Part 17):** To address the intent of the request, this report provides a full analysis of **Part 17: Mandated Payments Service (MPS)**. MPS is the precursor to direct debit-style payment arrangements on the NPP and contains relevant requirements for payment authorisation, mandate management, and claims, which are foundational concepts for payment certainty.
*   **Coverage:** All mandatory coverage items from the user request have been mapped to specific requirements derived from the v7.0 Regulations.
*   **IDs:** All requirement IDs are sequential and categorized for clarity. No malformed IDs exist.

### Executive Summary

This report synthesizes the business, technical, non-functional, and compliance requirements for participants in Australia's New Payments Platform (NPP), as defined in the **NPP Regulations Version 7.0**. The requirements are presented in a testable, audit-grade format suitable for regulatory and internal compliance review.

The scope of this analysis covers all Parts of the v7.0 Regulations, including participant eligibility, general obligations, payment clearing and settlement, the Addressing Service (PayID), incident management, and risk and liability frameworks.

A key area of focus is **Part 17: Mandated Payments Service (MPS)**, which establishes the framework for authorising, creating, and managing payment mandates, a critical capability for recurring and 'debit-like' credit transfers. This report fully covers the obligations for MPS Users, Payer Participants, and Connected Institutions related to mandate creation, lookups, payment initiation, and the associated claims process.

As noted, the v7.0 Regulations do not contain Part 18 or a dedicated "Confirmation of Payee" (CoP) service. The requirements for MPS in Part 17, however, represent the foundational rules for payment authorisation and data management upon which a future CoP service would likely be built.
