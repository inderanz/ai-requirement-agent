### Editorâ€™s Note

This document has been generated from scratch based on the provided "New Payments Platform (NPP) Regulations Version 7.0_20 May 2020" PDF, as per the request to produce a requirements analysis for "v21.0".

**Key Changes and Additions to meet the request:**

*   **Version Discrepancy:** The analysis is based on the provided **NPP Regulations v7.0 (20 May 2020)**. The title reflects the requested "v21.0", but all content and citations refer to the v7.0 source document.
*   **Confirmation of Payee (Part 18):** The request specified coverage of CoP from Part 18 of v21.0. This part is not present in the v7.0 source document. A placeholder section has been created to acknowledge this gap.
*   **Mandatory Coverage Checklist:** All items from the checklist have been addressed and incorporated as specific, citable requirements:
    *   **Risk & Liability (Part 2):** Captured in requirements `BR-LIA-01` to `BR-LIA-04`. The principle of Participants acting as principals is covered in `BR-GOV-01`.
    *   **Suspension & Termination (Part 9):** Captured in `BR-GOV-04` to `BR-GOV-07`.
    *   **Reporting & NPP Reports (Part 3/16):** Captured in `BR-ADMIN-04` to `BR-ADMIN-07`.

# New Payments Platform (NPP) Regulations v21.0

| | |
|---|---|
| **Version** | 21.0 (Analysis based on source document v7.0) |
| **Date** | 24 September 2024 |
| **Prepared for** | GitHub Issue #4 |
| **Source Document** | New Payments Platform (NPP) Regulations v7.0 (20 May 2020) |

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the business and technical requirements derived from the New Payments Platform (NPP) Regulations. It is intended for use by business analysts, architects, and compliance officers to ensure systems and processes align with the NPP framework.

The requirements are categorized into Business, Technical, Controls, and ISO 20022-specific sections, providing a clear and auditable structure. Each requirement is traced back to a specific regulation in the source document.

A key aspect of the v21.0 regulations, **Confirmation of Payee (CoP)**, is expected to be detailed in **Part 18**. However, the provided source document (v7.0) does not contain this part. This analysis therefore includes a placeholder for CoP requirements, which will be populated upon receipt of the v21.0 source material. All other requirements are based on the comprehensive v7.0 document, covering participation, payment clearing and settlement, addressing services (PayID), risk management, and operational mandates.
